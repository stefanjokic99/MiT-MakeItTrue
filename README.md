# MiT-MakeItTrue (Graphical Combinatorial Network Editor) 

## About the Project

The "Graphical Combinatorial Network Editor" is a Java Swing application designed for creating and editing combinatorial network diagrams. This project was developed as part of the Software Design course during the 4th year at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in East Sarajevo.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Graphical Combinatorial Network Editor
- **Development Environment:** Java Swing
- **My Role:** Project Manager, Software Engineer and Designer

## What I Learned?

The project encompasses the following significant aspects and functionalities:

- **Architecture Design:** The project involved designing and creating the architecture for the graphical editor. This architecture was developed with a focus on extensibility, allowing for the addition of new features and components in the future.

- **Model-Delegate Architecture:** The software employs a model-delegate architecture that separates the data model from the user interface. This design promotes maintainability and allows for more straightforward changes and additions to the application.

- **Design Patterns:** Various design patterns were utilized during the architecture's creation to ensure code reusability, maintainability, and modularity.

- **Team Leadership:**  I led a team in the development of this project, following the RUP (Rational Unified Process) methodology. We used the Redmine system for team monitoring and project management.
